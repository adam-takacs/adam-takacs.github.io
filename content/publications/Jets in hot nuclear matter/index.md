abstract: "In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, protons and neutrons melt and form the quark-gluon plasma. The modification of jets, propagating through this deconfined medium, has been extensively studied at the CERN-LHC, and the BNL-RHIC colliders experiments. Over the last decade, extensive knowledge has piled up in the theory of jet modification. This thesis presents a consistent and state-of-the-art perspective of jet modification based on perturbative QCD. Considering recent progress toward a more accurate description of jets in high-energy physics, jet modification in the medium is reviewed by focusing on their all-order perturbative structure and defining the accuracy of quenched jet observables."
