The goal of the workshop was to focus on some of the open questions in the field of high-energy heavy-ion physics and to stimulate the formulation of concrete suggestions for making progresses on both the experimental and theoretical sides. The paper gives a brief introduction to each topic and then summarizes the primary results.","tags":null,"title":"QCD challenges from pp to AA collisions: 4th edition","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Leticia Cunqueiro","Daniel Pablos","Alba Soto-Ontoso","Martin Spousta","Adam Takacs","Marta Verweij"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1699833600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1699833600,"objectID":"637556daa3251124979f4483fcac965f","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publications/isolating-perturbative-qcd-splittings-in-heavy-ion-collisions/","publishdate":"2023-11-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/isolating-perturbative-qcd-splittings-in-heavy-ion-collisions/","section":"publications","summary":"This work outlines an extensive measurement plan to answer the most fundamental questions of jet quenching.","tags":null,"title":"Isolating perturbative QCD splittings in heavy-ion collisions","type":"publications"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1698105600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698105600,"objectID":"4e341564189a2e1a1cb21603ba4c1d9e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/experience/","publishdate":"2023-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/experience/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Experience","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Adam Takacs"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1697587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697587200,"objectID":"c7d11abc7e430afc5fff340752291f80","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/talks/seattle2024/","publishdate":"2023-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/seattle2024/","section":"talks","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exploring perturbative QCD splittings in heavy-ion collisions","type":"talks"},{"authors":["Adam Takacs"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1697587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697587200,"objectID":"6172986bcfbe00b3471c953b9d55f5be","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/talks/ismd2023/","publishdate":"2023-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/ismd2023/","section":"talks","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Jets in hot nuclear matter","type":"talks"},{"authors":["Adam Takacs"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1693958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693958400,"objectID":"a9ed0303c9c01408da0310544c4f5d5a","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/talks/quarkmatter2023/","publishdate":"2023-09-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/quarkmatter2023/","section":"talks","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Exploring perturbative QCD splittings in heavy-ion collisions","type":"talks"},{"authors":["Adam Takacs"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1687219200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687219200,"objectID":"360cf06e1010bb8a72956e35a537fe98","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publications/jets-in-hot-nuclear-matter/","publishdate":"2023-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/jets-in-hot-nuclear-matter/","section":"publications","summary":"In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, protons and neutrons melt and form the quark-gluon plasma. The modification of jets, propagating through this deconfined medium, has been extensively studied at the CERN-LHC, and the BNL-RHIC colliders experiments. Over the last decade, extensive knowledge has piled up in the theory of jet modification. This thesis presents a consistent and state-of-the-art perspective of jet modification based on perturbative QCD. Considering recent progress toward a more accurate description of jets in high-energy physics, jet modification in the medium is reviewed by focusing on their all-order perturbative structure and defining the accuracy of quenched jet observables.","tags":null,"title":"Jets in hot nuclear matter: Resumming multiple emissions in QCD","type":"publications"},{"authors":["Adam Takacs"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1676246400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676246400,"objectID":"bb4f0214d4b193ddbbd3851517c04e1c","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/talks/qcdchallenges2023/","publishdate":"2023-02-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/qcdchallenges2023/","section":"talks","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Color coherence in the weakly coupled picture","type":"talks"},{"authors":["Adam Takacs"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1669766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669766400,"objectID":"cdb2709a073697d466fda47f03d77d1b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/talks/qcd@lhc2022/","publishdate":"2022-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/qcd@lhc2022/","section":"talks","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Dynamically groomed jet radius in heavy-ion collisions","type":"talks"},{"authors":["Johannes Hamre Isaksen","Adam Takacs","Konrad Tywoniuk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654473600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654473600,"objectID":"f99b04170d6c712a9ada69d72c44fe72","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publications/a-unified-picture-of-medium-induced-radiation/","publishdate":"2022-06-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/a-unified-picture-of-medium-induced-radiation/","section":"publications","summary":"We present a new framework in which different jet quenching models are unified.
