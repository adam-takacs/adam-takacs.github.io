abstract: "We explore the ability of a recently proposed jet substructure technique, dynamical grooming, to pin down the properties of the quark-gluon plasma formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. In particular, we compute, both analytically and via Monte Carlo simulations, the opening angle $\\theta_g$ of the hardest splitting in the jet as defined by dynamical grooming. Our calculation, grounded in perturbative QCD (pQCD), accounts for the factorization in time between vacuum-like and medium-induced processes in the double logarithmic approximation. We observe that the dominant scale in the $\\theta_g$ distribution is the decoherence angle $\\theta_c$ which characterizes the resolution power of the medium to propagating color probes. This feature also persists in strong coupling models for jet quenching. We further propose for potential experimental measurements a suitable combination of the dynamical grooming condition and the jet radius that leads to a pQCD-dominated observable with a very small sensitivity ($\\lesssim 10\\%$) to medium response."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We present the state of the art of analytic jet substructure resummation in the quark gluon plasma. We propose dynamical grooming to test the color charge resolution property of the QGP and to test the medium response and jet thermalization.
